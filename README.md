A repository of my dotfiles.

Usage
-----

To install the dotfiles, clone the repo and run `make`.

    git clone git://github.com/finiks/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    make

This will make symbolic links on your `~/` directory. Take note that this process will overwrite any existing configuration files.
