A repository of my dotfiles.

Usage
-----

First, clone the repository.

    git clone git://github.com/finiks/dotfiles.git
    
Change your working directory into the cloned repository.

    cd dotfiles
    
Finally, use the created Makefile.

    make

This will make symbolic links in your `~/` directory. Take note that this process will overwrite any existing configuration files.
